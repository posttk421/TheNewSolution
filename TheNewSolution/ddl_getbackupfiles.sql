Name: sp_Getbckfilestodel
Author: Dustin Marzolf
Created: 2/26/2016

Update 5/13/2016 - Dustin Marzolf
	Updated due to new field names in related tables.
	Updated to not return backups that have already been deleted.
 Output:
	a Table with two columns, a list of files (path and names) and a database.
	
Notes:

The Rules are as follows.

It is expected that we need to delete the prior full backup if we are taking a full backup as
there won't be enough space on the disk.  As such, the logic depends on what is about to be done.

If the expected backup type is a FULL backup then it is safe to delete all prior files (FULL and LOG)

If the expected backup type is a LOG backup then we need to keep the immediately prior FULL and the subsequent LOGS on hand.
